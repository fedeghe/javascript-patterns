# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration

) what happens if you don't provide it.
> An HTML document which lacks a DOCTYPE will be rendered in bugwards compatibility mode, since it is assumed to be an older document which was written before DOCTYPE became widely used.

) Diff between display:block, display:inline, display:inline-block.
> An inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML elements next to it.
  A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it.
  An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.

>	UX
	1) 

	2) do not let the user choose check-out date value before check-in date (in the selects, the calendar works right) 

	3a) in the result page it seem like You want to hide the price

	3b) not visible a contact for the location selected (wanted?)

	3c) in both list and grind mode the gallery buttons not responds correctly at first click

	4) when the user use more than one checkbox filter (or whatever) show a “reset all filters” button.

	5) too many font sizes, the entire site seem to not follow a clear cute color palette
	   style can get really better 

	5) the “show map” can get much better, but really better, try to:
	  > show map for a result, mouse out the baloon, hover it again #FAIL
	  > show map for a result, click marker, back to result, WTF the map stands for?
