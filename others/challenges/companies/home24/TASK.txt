Create single page ecommerce application with following guidelines:
> after opening a page, user sees list of products
> each product is displayed as:
    ) Name
    ) Image
    ) Price
    ) “Add to cart” button

After clicking on “Add to cart” button following actions are executed:
> dummy backend script is notified about user action (this script does not have to store
  any data, only status reply is required)
> product is added to cart
> cart overlay is displayed

Besides list of products, there is a ‘My cart’ button. Clicking on it displays cart
overlay with all products previously added to cart as:
> Name
> Image
> Price
> “Remove” button

Product can be removed from cart overlay by clicking on “Remove” button inside cart overlay

Scroll on product list have to load more products via Ajax: infinite scrolling



HINT: As long as possible, stay with native JavaScript, avoid external libraries, the only exception is jQuery (can be used)
